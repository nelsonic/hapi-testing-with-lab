Followed the tutorial but when ever I run `node .` or `npm test` I get the following error:

**Error: Invalid routeConfig options (/users/{username})**

Sent @_expr a tweet asking for help:

@_expr replied with a pull request.

Had to change the **path** to **params** for Hapi 5.x

All working now.
But code coverage is low because the tests do not force
errors to follow the error-checking branches.
